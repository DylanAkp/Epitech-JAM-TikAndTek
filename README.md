# Epitech-JAM-TikAndTek

Tik And Tek is a video game I made in 48h for the Epitech Jam from March 24th 2023 to March 26th 2023.

The theme is "Parallels".

The concept of the game is based on Ibb&Obb, you will control, with two controllers, two ghosts who will take a similar route but parallel to your teammate
